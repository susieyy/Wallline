## Usage

* Drop the WBNoticeView folder in your project
* Add QuartzCore.framework to your project

### NoticeView 1.0 vs 2.0

The behavior in version 1 was "fire and forget". Calling *showErrorNoticeInView* or *showSuccessNoticeInView* displayed the notice, but there was no way to retain it for later use. Version 2 allows the developer to instantiate a notice, customize it (optional) and show it. Not only it's possible to retain it, but also customize it anytime with say, a different title and message. Oh, yeah… and it's cleaner too.

### New in 2.1: Sticky Notice

New in 2.1 is a different type of notice: Sticky. As it name implies, the notice will remain visible until the user taps on it to dismiss it. The usage follows the Error and Success notice pattern:

    WBStickyNoticeView *notice = [WBStickyNoticeView stickyNoticeInView:self.view title:@"7 New Tweets."];
    [notice show];

### Examples

Since version 2 is more flexible, I have eliminated the older examples and replaced them with the new API. Please note that the older API is still there, for backward compatibility.

To display a small error notice:

    WBErrorNoticeView *notice = [WBErrorNoticeView errorNoticeInView:self.view title:@"Network Error" message:@"Check your network connection."];
    [notice show];
	
If the message provided doesn't fit in one line, the notice will be enlarged to accommodate the text:

    WBErrorNoticeView *notice = [WBErrorNoticeView errorNoticeInView:self.view title:@"Network Error" message:@"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book."];
    [notice show];

To display a small success notice:

    WBSuccessNoticeView *notice = [WBSuccessNoticeView successNoticeInView:self.view title:@"Link Saved Successfully"];
    [notice show];
    
### Customizing the Notice

Instead of piling up a bunch of arguments in a method call, I decided to use properties instead. This way, new properties can be added easily without having to clutter the API with specialized methods.

Example: customize a success notice with a bit of transparency and placing the notice at a specific Y coordinate:

    WBSuccessNoticeView *notice = [WBSuccessNoticeView successNoticeInView:self.view title:@"Link Saved Successfully"];
    
    notice.alpha = 0.8;
    notice.originY = self.headerView.frame.size.height;
    
    [notice show];

	
## Notes

> If you pass nil instead of a valid UIView, an NSInvalidArgumentException exception will be raised.

The default values are the following:

        if (nil == title) title = @"Unknown Error";
        if (nil == message) message = @"Information not provided.";
        if (0.0 == duration) duration = 0.5;
        if (0.0 == delay) delay = 2.0;
        if (0.0 == alpha) alpha = 1.0;
		if (origin < 0.0) origin = 0.0;
